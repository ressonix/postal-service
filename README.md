# Postal Service

Postal Service is a collection of useful tools for email. The only tool implemented at the moment is an email migration
tool, but feel free to submit feature requests or contribute yourself.

## Developers

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start adding or editing pages by modifying files under the `pages/` directory. It will auto-update as you edit
files.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be added or edited in the `pages/api/` directory.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
